**About Dataset**
A dataset containing basic conversations, mental health FAQ, classical therapy conversations, and general advice provided to people suffering from anxiety and depression.

This dataset can be used to train a model for a chatbot that can behave like a therapist in order to provide emotional support to people with anxiety & depression.

The dataset contains intents. An “intent” is the intention behind a user's message. For instance, If I were to say “I am sad” to the chatbot, the intent, in this case, would be “sad”. Depending upon the intent, there is a set of Patterns and Responses appropriate for the intent. Patterns are some examples of a user’s message which aligns with the intent while Responses are the replies that the chatbot provides in accordance with the intent. Various intents are defined and their patterns and responses are used as the model’s training data to identify a particular intent.
